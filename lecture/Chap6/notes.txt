Summary of previous lect:

In SAS we have 
  proc sgplot;
    scatter x=ht y=wt / group=gender; #one graph
  proc sgplot;
    class=gender; #got a statement to separate the graph, separate graph

In R we have
  par(mfrow=c(2,1)) #one for male one for female separate graph
  plot(...)
  plot(...)
  plot(htf,wtf) #default col and pch
  points(htm,wtm pch=.. col=..) #need to set

chapt 5:
 #he nvr go thru r and sas for "plot bivariate data"
  (SPSS)
  plot bivariate data -> "Graphs -> "Chart Builder"-> "one one entry" -> "drag variables" to "chart..."
  is there 
 
chapt 6:
  6.2: they maybe outliers, outliers will not affect so much 
  6.3: location, scale 
  6.4: Robust location estimators 
        1) Trimmed mean(remove bigger and smaller one, eg 10% TM both ends)
        2) Winsorized mean(eg 10% WM, replace these portion with the left over head and tail of the 80%)
        3) Humber's M-estimator
        4) Tukey's bisquare......
  6.5: skewed to the right, eg 18 and 27, the graph gt mistake inconsistent 
        10%-> change to 20% 
        20% trimmed mean= 9
        20% and lowest 20% of the observations
        20% winsorized mean
  6.6: M-estimators for location (least square method) see image
  6.15 IQR 

  chapt6:
    IQR throw away 50% of data, MAD(median absolute deviation) throw away more data. This is more ROBUST
